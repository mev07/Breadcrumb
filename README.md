# Breadcrumb
Implementation of a user-path based Javascript Breadcrumb which uses browser's session storage
If a site appears more than once in the breadcrumb, it should clear all sites between as well as the second appearence of the site
Reloading the breadcrumb is desired if the user loads the site and if he navigtes to sub-pages of the website
As i'm new to coding with JS, im open for improvement and advice
